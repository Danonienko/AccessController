# ClearanceController
A TypeScript library for Roblox that provides a comprehensive clearance control system for managing keycards, security clearance levels, and gatekeeper functionality.

## Features
- üîë Keycard management system
- üìä Clearance level hierarchy
- üö™ Gatekeeper clearance control
- ‚ú® Type-safe implementation using roblox-ts
- üõ°Ô∏è Robust validation using @rbxts/t

## Usage
### Basic Implementation
```typescript
import ClearanceController from "ClearanceController";

// Check if a player has clearance to a gatekeeper
const hasClearance = ClearanceController.PlayerHasClearance(player, gatekeeper);

// Get player's highest clearance level
const clearanceLevel = ClearanceController.GetPlayerClearanceLevel(player);
```

### Keycard Configuration
Keycards must be configured with the following structure:

```lua
-- Tool instance with the "KeyCard" tag
local keyCard = Instance.new("Tool")
keyCard:AddTag("KeyCard")

-- Configuration
local config = Instance.new("Configuration")
config.Name = "KeyCardConfig"

local level = Instance.new("NumberValue")
level.Name = "Level"
level.Value = 5  -- Set clearance level

local bypass = Instance.new("BoolValue")
bypass.Name = "LockDownBypass"
bypass.Value = false  -- Set bypass permission

config.Parent = keyCard
level.Parent = config
bypass.Parent = config
```

### Gatekeeper Configuration
Gatekeepers must be configured with the following structure:

```lua
local gatekeeper = Instance.new("Part")  -- or any other instance

local config = Instance.new("Configuration")
config.Name = "GatekeeperConfig"

-- Required values
local clearance = Instance.new("NumberValue")
clearance.Name = "Clearance"
clearance.Value = 3  -- Required clearance level

local keyCards = Instance.new("Folder")
keyCards.Name = "KeyCards"

-- Parent everything
config.Parent = gatekeeper
clearance.Parent = config
keyCards.Parent = config
```

## API Reference
### `GetPlayerClearanceLevel(player: Player): number`
Returns the highest clearance level the player has based on their keycards.

### `GetPlayerKeyCards(player: Player): KeyCard[]`
Returns an array of KeyCard instances the player has in their backpack.

### `GetGatekeeperClearanceLevel(gatekeeper: Gatekeeper): number`
Returns the clearance level required by the gatekeeper.

### `GetGatekeeperKeyCards(gatekeeper: Gatekeeper): string[]`
Returns an array of KeyCard names that the gatekeeper accepts.

### `PlayerHasClearance(player: Player, gatekeeper: Gatekeeper): boolean`
Returns whether the player has clearance to the gatekeeper based on:
- Player's clearance level vs gatekeeper's required level
- Player's keycards vs gatekeeper's accepted cards
